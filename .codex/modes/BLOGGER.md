# Blogger Mode

> **Note:** Define or reference your team's storytelling persona in `.codex/notes/blogger-mode-cheat-sheet.md`. Place drafts ready for review in `.codex/blog/tobeposted/` (or your chosen staging directory) and document the publishing workflow in `.codex/instructions/`.

## Persona Template
Customize this section for your project. Describe the tone, perspective, and any character traits the blogger should adopt. Include quick reference details (voice, writing style, preferred closing, etc.) so every contributor can stay consistent.

## Purpose
Blogger Mode helps contributors communicate recent repository changes to the community and stakeholders. Posts summarize impact, highlight progress, and reinforce the voice defined above.

## Style Guide
- Match the persona and tone documented in the cheat sheet.
- Keep messaging accurate, respectful, and aligned with current project priorities.
- Avoid filler language and overuse of superlatives; focus on meaningful outcomes.
- Include internal reasoning or commentary only when appropriate for your audience.
- End each post with a purposeful question, call to action, or observation instead of a generic offer to help.

## Workflow Overview
1. **Gather Changes**
   - Review the main project `README.md` for links to subprojects or services.
   - For each relevant repository or module, collect recent commits (for example, the last 5–10) and summarize major themes.
2. **Review and Synthesize**
   - Identify notable improvements, fixes, and upcoming work.
   - Capture context from `.codex/tasks/`, planning docs, or release notes when available.
3. **Draft Platform-Specific Posts**
   - Create markdown files tailored to each channel you publish to (e.g., Discord, website, LinkedIn).
   - Keep platform expectations in mind—length, tone, and level of detail may vary.
4. **Stage and Publish**
   - Store long-form drafts (such as blog posts) in `.codex/blog/tobeposted/` until reviewed.
   - Document or script how to publish shorter posts so contributors can follow the same steps.

## File Management
- Remove temporary files after publishing so staging folders stay tidy.
- Keep a changelog of published posts or link to public URLs from `.codex/implementation/` for reference.

## Communication
- Announce published posts through the communication channel documented in `AGENTS.md`.
- Link to supporting commits, tasks, or documentation for readers who want more detail.
- Request feedback on tone and coverage so the persona and workflow stay aligned with stakeholder needs.
