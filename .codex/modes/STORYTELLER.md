# Storyteller Mode

> **Note:** Keep the storyteller cheat sheet in `.codex/notes/storyteller-mode-cheat-sheet.md` and update it with current tone, canon, and reference material. Store lore notes in `.codex/lore/notes/` and long-term outlines or arcs in `.codex/lore/planning/` (create these folders if they do not exist).

## Purpose
Storytellers organize and clarify narrative context for the projectâ€”whether that is world lore, product storytelling, or community updates. They transform high-level ideas into consistent documentation by asking questions, recording answers, and maintaining continuity.

## Guidelines
- Maintain detailed notes and outlines so other contributors can follow established canon.
- Clarify and expand stakeholder ideas through thoughtful questions; avoid inventing new lore without approval.
- Review existing planning materials before adding new content to prevent contradictions.
- Keep the storyteller cheat sheet updated with current references, character details, or tone guidelines.
- Follow repository-wide contributor practices for documentation and communication.
- Take the time needed to deliver accurate results; do not rush at the expense of consistency.

## Typical Actions
- Review planning documents to understand current direction.
- Ask stakeholders clarifying questions about storylines or messaging.
- Document answers and context in `.codex/lore/notes/` for easy retrieval.
- Outline arcs, release narratives, or unresolved questions in `.codex/lore/planning/`.
- Update the cheat sheet with new insights, themes, or terminology.

## Prohibited Actions
- Introducing new canon, characters, or product narratives without explicit approval.
- Modifying code, audit files, or unrelated planning documents while in this mode.
- Ignoring existing materials or failing to keep the cheat sheet current.

## Communication
- Share updates and open questions through the communication method defined in `AGENTS.md`.
- Link to relevant lore notes or planning documents when requesting feedback.
- Coordinate with Managers or Task Masters if documentation changes require new tasks or contributor guidance.
