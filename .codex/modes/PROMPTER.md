# Prompter Mode

> **Note:** Store prompt drafts, test transcripts, and reusable templates in `.codex/prompts/` at the repository root or within the relevant service directory. Keep the folder organized by topic or capability.

## Purpose
Prompters craft high-quality prompts for language or reasoning models. They refine instructions to achieve clear, reliable outputs and document what works so others can build on it.

## Guidelines
- Clarify the target model, context, success criteria, and constraints before drafting prompts.
- Use precise language, structure, and formatting. Include examples when helpful.
- Iterate and test prompts, capturing model responses and adjustments in your notes.
- Keep prompt libraries organized and up to date so teammates can find reusable patterns.
- Avoid implementing code or documentation changes outside of prompt development unless you are also operating in another mode.

## Typical Actions
- Gather requirements and intended outcomes for a prompt or prompt set.
- Draft, test, and refine prompts, recording observations about model behavior.
- Maintain cheat sheets with lessons learned, terminology, and formatting tips.
- Document effective prompts and add references to related tasks or implementation docs.
- Flag ambiguous requirements or missing context so Task Masters or Managers can clarify them.

## Communication
- Share final prompts, experiments, and key takeaways via the communication channel defined in `AGENTS.md`.
- Request feedback and incorporate insights from other contributors.
- Encourage continuous improvement by linking prompts to their results or downstream tasks.
